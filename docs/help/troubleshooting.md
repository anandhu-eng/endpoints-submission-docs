# Troubleshooting

Indexed by what you see. Search this page for a fragment of your error message.

!!! note "Derived from documented behaviour, not from observed support cases"
    MLPerf Endpoints has not completed a submission round under these rules. Every entry is derived
    from a documented failure mode in the tooling or a stated rule, not from failures seen in the
    wild. Once real support threads exist, this page should be rewritten from them.

## Authentication

??? failure "Every command fails with an authentication error"
    **Cause:** the token is missing, mistyped, or not scoped correctly.

    **Fix:**

    1. Confirm the variable is set and starts with `mlc_`:
       ```bash
       echo "${PRISM_USER_API_TOKEN:0:4}"
       ```
    2. Confirm the key was created with **Service Scope: MLPerf Endpoints**. A key scoped to another
       service authenticates against a different surface.
    3. Try `--token` explicitly to rule out a shell-profile problem.

    See [step 1](../workflow/register.md).

??? failure "Connection errors, or requests going somewhere unexpected"
    **Cause:** `MLPERF_API_BASE_URL` is set.

    **Fix:** unset it. It defaults to `https://api.mlcommons.org` and should only be overridden for
    dev or staging environments.
    ```bash
    unset MLPERF_API_BASE_URL
    ```

## Installation

??? failure "`inference-endpoint: command not found`"
    **Cause:** the venv is not activated, or you installed with `uv sync` and dropped the prefix.

    **Fix:** either `source .venv/bin/activate`, or prefix every command with `uv run`.

??? failure "Dependency versions differ from what the project expects"
    **Cause:** you installed with `pip` rather than `uv sync`. The pip path does **not** use
    `uv.lock`.

    **Fix:** for a submission, prefer `uv sync` so your dependency set matches the lockfile. Record
    the commit SHA you built from either way, since you need it for disclosure.

??? failure "Submission commands fail mentioning GitHub"
    **Cause:** `gh` is missing or unauthenticated. It is required for creating, updating and
    withdrawing submissions.

    **Fix:** install the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) and run `gh auth login`.

## Running the benchmark

??? failure "`result_summary.json` shows `complete: false`"
    **Cause:** the run drained out or was interrupted. The metrics are partial.

    **Fix:** the point is **not usable** — re-run it. Check whether you hit
    `run_timeout_s`, a drain timeout, or `endpoint_response_idle_timeout_s`.

    A `state` of `INTERRUPTED` means the run was aborted; `state: complete` with pending tasks means
    a drain timeout.

??? failure "The run ends far sooner than the region minimum"
    **Cause:** sample-count sizing. With no explicit count and no minimum issue duration, the client
    issues the dataset **once** and stops.

    **Fix:** set `settings.runtime.n_samples_to_issue`, or `min_issue_duration_ms`, so the run
    sustains 600 s (Ultra Low) or 1,200 s (other regions) of steady state.

    Priority order: `n_samples_to_issue` > Poisson QPS × min issue duration > dataset size.

??? failure "A percentile lookup in `result_summary.json` returns nothing"
    **Cause:** percentile keys are **decimal strings** — `"50.0"`, `"90.0"`, `"99.9"`, not `"50"`
    or `"90"`.

    **Fix:** use the decimal form.

??? failure "Dataset validation fails saying samples cannot be salted"
    **Cause:** salt requires a dict sample with a text `prompt` field. A dataset whose samples carry
    `messages`, or multimodal content parts, cannot be salted, and the client validates every
    sample up front rather than shipping an unsalted payload.

    **Fix:** use a dataset with a text `prompt`, or disable the warmup salt, but if warmup uses the
    performance dataset, **salting is mandatory**, so the dataset must support it.

??? failure "The endpoint stops responding and the run hangs"
    **Cause:** no liveness deadline set.

    **Fix:**
    ```yaml
    settings:
      timeouts:
        endpoint_response_idle_timeout_s: 300   # >= 300; raise for long requests
    ```

??? failure "`from-config` ignores `--report-dir`"
    **Cause:** not a bug. `from-config` accepts only `--config`, `--timeout` and `--mode`.

    **Fix:** set `report_dir` in the YAML.

## Disclosure files

??? failure "The checker reports missing `point.yaml` or `system_desc.json`"
    **Cause:** you expected a tool to generate them. Nothing does.

    **Fix:** author both by hand and place them at the top level of every run folder. See
    [step 5](../workflow/author-disclosures.md),
    [`point.yaml`](../reference/point-yaml.md) and
    [`system_desc.json`](../reference/system-desc-json.md).

??? failure "Fields you set in `config.yaml` do not appear in the submission"
    **Cause:** `point.yaml` is copied **verbatim**. The CLI does not derive it from `config.yaml`
    and does not fill in missing fields.

    **Fix:** put every required disclosure field in `point.yaml` itself.

??? failure "`shared-path-resolution` fails"
    **Cause:** `shared_src` or `shared_docs` does not resolve to an existing directory under the
    submission root.

    **Fix:** correct the pointers in every `point.yaml`. This check **rejects** the submission.

??? failure "`tps-utilization` fails"
    **Cause:** the value is not `system_tps / max(system_tps)` across your own curve.

    **Fix:** recompute after **every** point has run. You cannot fill it in before then.

## Validation failures

??? failure "`point-count` fails: fewer than 7 points"
    **Cause:** too few points, or points were withdrawn.

    **Fix:** run more. Note withdrawn points do not count toward the minimum and **cannot be
    replaced**, because there's no `add-run`. If the curve needs a different set of runs, create a new
    submission.

??? failure "A concurrency-coverage check fails"
    **Cause:** no point in one of Low, Medium or High Concurrency — often because `C_min` changed.

    **Fix:**
    ```bash
    submission-checker regions --max-concurrency <C_max> --min-concurrency <your lowest point>
    ```
    Remember `C_min` is **derived from your own lowest point**, so dropping that point moves every
    other boundary. And a point in the 10% margin does **not** satisfy High Concurrency.

??? failure "`region-placement` warns"
    **Cause:** the `region` you declared in `point.yaml` disagrees with the computed one.

    **Fix:** correct the declared value. It is only a warning, but it is exactly the kind of thing a
    reviewer files a methodology objection about.

??? failure "`seed-set-adoption` reports SKIP"
    **Cause:** the bundled seed-set file carries no cohort keys, so the adoption test cannot run.

    **Fix:** none available locally. Confirm the correct seed set with MLCommons, and point
    `--seed-sets FILE` or `$MLPERF_ENDPOINTS_SEED_SETS` at a newer file if one exists. Tracked as
    **B4** in [Open questions](open-questions.md).

??? failure "`accuracy-gate` fails"
    **Cause:** the accuracy run missed the benchmark quality target.

    **Fix:** there is **no tolerance** — this rejects the submission. Check whether an approximation
    permitted under [model equivalence](../rules/model-equivalence.md) pushed you below the target;
    dynamic approximate sparsity and aggressive PTQ are both gated on exactly this.

## Submission failures

??? failure "`Run folder error: … is missing required file(s): performance/result_summary.json`"
    **Cause:** a flat run folder with the summary at the top level.

    **Fix:** use the layout the reference client writes — the summary belongs under `performance/`.
    Flat layouts are not accepted. See [Submission package layout](../reference/package-layout.md).

??? failure "The build fails naming a specific run"
    **Cause:** the builder cannot tell whether the run is an accuracy or a performance run. It reads
    `datasets[].type` from `config.yaml`, then falls back to `point.yaml`'s `dataset_type`, but only
    when that is exactly `Accuracy` or `Performance`.

    **Fix:** supply `config.yaml`, or set `dataset_type` to exactly `Accuracy` or `Performance`.
    `Accuracy + Performance` describes the dataset, not the run, and is rejected on purpose:
    guessing used to file accuracy runs as performance runs and silently drop the accuracy results.

??? failure "`submissions update --run-ids` is rejected"
    **Cause:** the list would **add** a run. The post-submission window for adding points was removed.

    **Fix:** the list may only shrink. To remove one point, use `submissions remove-run`. For a
    different set of runs, create a new submission.

??? failure "A run cannot be deleted"
    **Cause:** it belongs to an active submission.

    **Fix:** `submissions withdraw` first, then `runs delete`.

??? failure "The upload failed and you are unsure of the state"
    **Cause:** partial failure. The CLI rolls back automatically — a failed run-archive upload
    deletes the run record; a failed bundle upload withdraws the submission.

    **Fix:** if rollback also failed, the CLI prints the orphaned ID. Clean it up:
    ```bash
    endpoints-submission-cli runs delete --run-id <orphaned-id>
    endpoints-submission-cli submissions withdraw --submission-id <orphaned-id>
    ```

??? failure "`pr_url` is empty after a successful submission"
    **Cause:** not a bug. The CLI no longer opens the review pull request.

    **Fix:** nothing. `pr_url` and `pr_number` populate once whatever opens it has set them.

??? failure "`submissions create` succeeded but status is not `REVIEW_PENDING`"
    **Cause:** the final PATCH step failed. Both submission and bundle exist — the CLI treats this as
    a warning, not a fatal error.

    **Fix:** the status can be set manually. Confirm with `submissions get`.

## During review

??? failure "You missed the 3-business-day response window"
    **Cause:** no one was watching the review thread.

    **Fix:** respond immediately. Penalties are **cumulative and non-reversible** — responding does
    not undo a penalty already incurred, but it prevents further escalation. At 10 business days the
    submission is withdrawn.

    See [After you submit](../workflow/after-submission.md).

??? failure "A measurement point turns out to be wrong during review"
    **Cause:** an error found after compliance passed.

    **Fix:** results may **not** be changed during peer review. Your options are to withdraw the
    point (`submissions remove-run`) or withdraw the submission. Withdrawn points do not count
    toward the 7-point minimum and cannot be replaced.
