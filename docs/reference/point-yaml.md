# `point.yaml`

The per-measurement-point disclosure file. One per Pareto point, at the top level of the run folder.

!!! danger "Authored by you, copied verbatim"
    No tool generates or completes this file. The submission CLI copies it into the bundle
    **verbatim** — it does not derive it from `config.yaml` and does not fill in missing fields.
    Whatever you write is what gets submitted and what gets checked.

Authored in [step 5](../workflow/author-disclosures.md).

## Required fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `concurrency` | The target concurrency level for this point |
| `region` | Which region this point satisfies — `low_latency`, `low_throughput`, `med_throughput`, `high_throughput`, or `submitters_choice` |
| `runtime_settings` | The settings used for the run: load pattern, `min_duration_ms`, `min_sample_count`, `stream_all_chunks` |
| `dataset` | Dataset name, and any `n_samples_from_dataset` override |
| `warmup` | The warmup declaration — see [below](#the-warmup-block) |
| `division` | `Standardized`, `Serviced` or `RDI` |
| `max_supported_concurrency` | Your declared `C_max` |
| `model_name` | Display name of the model; must be consistent across all external usages |
| `model_precision` | **Lowest** precision numerical format used for the weights. A model mixing FP16 and FP8 has `model_precision: FP8` |
| `link_to_model` | Link to the submitted model |
| `link_to_model_transformation` | Link to the calibration / quantization / transformation write-up |
| `model_notes` | Free-form supplementary notes |
| `dataset_name` | Display name of the dataset; consistent across external usages |
| `dataset_type` | `Accuracy`, `Performance`, or `Accuracy + Performance` — see the warning below |
| `dataset_link` | Link to the data used |
| `seed_set` | The seed set this submission is bound to |
| `target_cohort` | The cohort targeted, as `YYYY-MM-C0` / `YYYY-MM-C1` |
| `shared_src` | Pointer to the shared `src/` content this point used |
| `shared_docs` | Pointer to the shared `docs/` content this point used |
| `steady_state` | The reporting block described [below](#the-steady-state-block) |

## The steady-state block

Added in 2026-09. It records how the point's official numbers were derived — see
[What your numbers are measured over](metrics-and-regions.md#what-your-numbers-are-measured-over).

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `status` | `windowable`, `insufficient_duration`, `insufficient_passes` or `partial_dataset` |
| `window` | The super-pass range, sample count, the effective super-pass size used, and `duration_s` — the window's issue-time span, which is what gets checked against the minimum run duration |
| `state` | Per gating metric: `Plateau`, `Drifting Up` or `Drifting Down` |
| `anomaly` | Present **only** when the detector confirmed a level shift |

`total` metrics are reported alongside as supplementary.

!!! danger "The detector that produces these values is not released yet"
    The methodology, the script and its documentation live on an **unmerged branch** of
    `mlcommons/endpoints`; nothing matching is on `main`. So this field is required by the rules
    but not currently producible with released tooling. Ask MLCommons before you plan around it.
    Tracked as **B9** in [Open questions](../help/open-questions.md).

## The warmup block

Required by the run-requirements rules and checked by `warmup-present`.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `duration_s` | Seconds from the first warmup request to `TEST_STARTED` |
| `requests_issued` | Total warmup requests issued |
| `requests_completed` | Total warmup requests completed |
| `data_source` | Description of the warmup data and its origin — dataset name and split, synthetic generation method and parameters, or fixed prompt text |
| `concurrency` | Concurrency level used during warmup |
| `initialization_steps` | Platform-specific initialization performed (CUDA graph capture, engine loading, JIT triggers), and confirmation it completed before `TEST_STARTED` |

!!! warning "Warmup documentation is objection territory"
    Warmup is at your discretion, but because warmup state materially affects the measurement, the
    procedure must be documented in enough detail for an independent team to reproduce it.
    Incomplete or ambiguous warmup documentation is explicit grounds for a **Methodology objection**.

## `dataset_type` does real work

!!! danger "The builder will not guess"
    The bundle builder must know whether a run is an **accuracy** or a **performance** run. It reads
    `datasets[].type` from `config.yaml` first, then falls back to `point.yaml`'s `dataset_type` —
    but **only** when that value is exactly `Accuracy` or `Performance`.

    A `dataset_type` of `Accuracy + Performance` describes the *dataset*, not this run. With no
    `config.yaml` and that value, the build **fails**, naming the run.

    That strictness is deliberate. Defaulting to "performance" used to be silently destructive: an
    accuracy run shipped without a `config.yaml` would be filed as its concurrency's performance
    run, collide with the real one, and drop its accuracy results from the bundle.

## `shared_src` and `shared_docs`

Each point declares which shared content it used. Both must resolve to an existing directory under
the submission root.

!!! danger "Unresolvable pointers reject the submission"
    Checker rule `shared-path-resolution`. A point whose pointers are missing or do not resolve is
    incomplete.

## Checker rules that read this file

| Rule | Checks |
|---|---|
| `measurement-points-present` | Every `r<N>/` carries a `point.yaml` |
| `point-config-valid` | It parses against the `PointConfig` schema |
| `point-disclosure-complete` | Every required disclosure field is present |
| `point-dirname-concurrency` | The `r<N>/` directory name matches the declared concurrency *(warn)* |
| `region-declared` | `region` is one of the permitted values |
| `region-placement` | The declared region matches the computed one *(warn)* |
| `load-pattern` | `load_pattern` is `concurrency` with a positive level |
| `streaming-config` | `stream_all_chunks` is `True` |
| `point-duration` | The point meets its region's minimum duration *(warn)* |
| `min-query-count` | `n_samples_completed` meets the dataset minimum |
| `warmup-present` | The warmup declaration is present |
| `warmup-logs-retained` | Log retention is declared *(warn)* |
| `warmup-salt` | Warns when the warmup salt is enabled |
| `config-consistency-dataset` | All points use the same dataset |
| `seed-set-consistency` | Every point records the same seed set |
| `target-cohort` | `target_cohort` matches the cohort ID format |
| `shared-path-resolution` | `shared_src` / `shared_docs` resolve |
